# Simulating-a-Hydrogen-Molelcule-using-VQE

I've attempted calculating and plotting the ground state energy of a hydrogen molecule with the use of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver on Qiskit as a reading project this semester. I undertook this as a reading project to get acquainted with the Qiskit environment and to put my introductory understanding of Quantum Chemistry and Simulations to use. Also, the reading project enabled me to get a fair understanding of a few Fermion to Qubit mapping techniques like Barvyi-Kitaev Mapping,  Parity Mapping and Jordan Wigner Mapping.
